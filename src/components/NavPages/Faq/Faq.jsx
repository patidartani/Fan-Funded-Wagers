The advantage is that parlays often offer higher payouts than placing each pick individually, as the odds increase with each additional pick. However, the risk is higher because if any pick in the parlay loses, the entire parlay is lost.</p><p>Parlays can involve various types of picks, such as point spreads, moneylines, and over/unders, and are commonly used in sports betting.</p><h6>Q: How do Parlays work on Funded Wagers?</h6><p>On Funded Wagers, you can place parlay picks with a <strong>maximum line odds of +2500</strong>. This limit is set to encourage strategic decision-making and responsible betting. It's important to be mindful of this cap when creating your parlays to ensure you stay within the platform's rules.</p><h6>Q: What happens if one of my picks in a parlay results in a push?</h6><p>If one of your picks results in a push (i.e., a tie or draw), that pick will be removed from your parlay. The odds and potential payout will be recalculated based on the remaining valid picks. This ensures a fair and accurate result for your parlay on Funded Wagers.</p>"
